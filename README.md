# 2x2_Button_Matrix

As part of an ongoing project I'm not yet ready to release on here, I was looking for basic button boards I could use. And while there are several, they didn't
look like I had pictured and I didn't think they'd be comfortable to hold or use as a control. They were mostly square, and I couldn't tell the quality of the buttons
themselves or the circuitry used.

So I designed my own. It includes diodes and small capacitors for each button, to properly distinguish between buttons and allow chording.

When the code is ready to release, I'll update this to include a sample.
